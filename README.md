# dataModel.Hl7
Data models mapped from the HL7 official version. Available at http://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/ according to the license http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/license.html. Changes include the limitation of the recursive properties of the schemas to 4 levels and the replacement of the 'const' clause of the json schema to enum with single value to be compatible with yaml. Besides this lack of data types in the original schema is also fixed.
