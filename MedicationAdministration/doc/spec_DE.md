Es ist nicht erforderlich, dass ein Reference.identifier auf etwas verweist, das tatsächlich als FHIR-Instanz verfügbar ist, aber er MUSS auf ein Geschäftskonzept verweisen, von dem erwartet wird, dass es als FHIR-Instanz verfügbar ist, und diese Instanz muss zu einem FHIR-Ressourcentyp gehören, der von der Referenz erlaubt wird.

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.    
                      Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself)

            The type is the Canonical URL of Resource Definition that is the type this reference refers to. References are URLs that are relative to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ e.g. Patient is a reference to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient.
